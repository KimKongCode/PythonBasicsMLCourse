This project contains code related to the Python course held for 
students at Lindholmen Tekniska Gymnasium, a collaboration with Sylog 
VÃ¤st. The course provides an introduction to Machine Learning, as well 
as basic Python programming, and is currently held by Thor Salehi 
(@GladiaThor) and Kimberley French (@KimKongCode).
